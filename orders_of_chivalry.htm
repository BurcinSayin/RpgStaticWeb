<p align="center"><font color="#800080" face="Garamond" size="6">Orders of 
Chivalry of the Empire of Kalamar</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<span style="font-size: 16pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<font color="#800080" face="Garamond" size="4">The Empire of Kalamar contains 
three orders of chivalry which are used to denote the precedence of knights 
within the realm. The order of precedence is dependent upon the age of the 
knightly order with the oldest order, the Order of the Knights of the Platinum 
Lion, being considered the highest ranking knighthood and therefore being the 
most coveted. Several older orders were created by the Inakas line but the 
knights of these orders were forced to renounce their titles after the ascension 
of House Bakar to the Imperial Throne or face execution. Additionally, anybody 
in possession of the regalia of these orders faces immediate arrest and 
subsequent execution for treason. Hence, these orders have become extinct 
(although rumours suggest that the Guardians of the Hidden Flame continue to 
preserve the regalia of these orders in the readiness for the return of the 
Inakas line). </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<font color="#800080" face="Garamond" size="4">Only the Emperor, or those 
imperial officials to whom he delegates this authority, may dub a knight a 
member of one of the Kalamaran orders of chivalry. Thereafter, he or she is 
granted the title ‘Sir’ of ‘Dame’ and is entitled to be addressed as such. If 
the recipient already holds a higher title (for example a Baron) then they will 
generally use the highest title they are entitled to hold.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<font color="#800080" face="Garamond" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<font color="#800080" face="Garamond" size="4">Each of the orders is dividend 
into four ranks. These are (in ascending order) Knight, Knight Commander, Lord 
Knight, Grand Knight. With respect to precedence a knight of a higher order 
ranks before a knight of a lower order if they hold the same rank. Thus, a 
Knight of the Platinum Lion has precedence over a Knight of the Black Banner. If 
the knights hold different ranks that the rank determines precedence. Thus, a 
Knight Commander of the Black Banner has precedence over a Knight of the 
Platinum Lion. If, however, the holder of either knighthood also holds a noble 
title than his noble rank determines precedence.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<font color="#800080" face="Garamond" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<font color="#800080" face="Garamond" size="4">For each order there is only one 
Grand Knight at any point in time and that knight is considered to be the leader 
of that order, answerable only to the Emperor. This is an exception to the 
normal feudal rules of precedence in that the Grand Knight of each of these 
orders ranks higher that a Duke or even a Prince of the Blood. Only Royal 
Princes and the Emperor rank above them, making these highly coveted positions.
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<font color="#800080" face="Garamond" size="4">Each of the Kalamaran orders is 
characterised by distinctive regalia unique to that order. This regalia consist 
of a heavy set chain made of a different metal for each order consisting of coin 
sized links set with the gemstones of the order at the centre of which hangs a 
single pendent featuring the arms of the order and a sash with a single pendant 
featuring the arms of the order that is worn from the right shoulder to the left 
hip. For Knights the sash is simply the colour of their order. For Knight 
Commanders, Lord Knights and Grand Knights the sash is bordered by bronze, 
silver and gold borders respectively. Typically the chain is worn during formal 
occasions, such as coronations, when attending court etc, whilst the sash is 
worn during other times.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<font color="#800080" face="Garamond" size="4"><b>History:</b> Upon finally 
securing the Imperial Throne after the long civil war known as the Time of 
Misfortune, Emperor Vilik of the House Bakar needed a method to grant 
recognition to those who had faithfully served his cause and the old knighthood 
of the Inakas line would not do since they were reminders of the recently depose 
regime. He also decided it would be wise to establish a system to align the 
interests of ambition men within his realm with those of the Imperial Throne. 
Thus, the Emperor formally established two new knighthoods to replace the ones 
of old. The premiere knighthood was to be the Order of the Platinum Lion named 
after the lion on arms of House Bakar (which now became the Kalamaran emblem). 
Membership of this order was deliberately kept exclusive and was used by the 
Emperor (and his successors) as a means to ensuring that the restless energies 
of their subjects were directed towards pleasing the Imperial Throne not 
coveting it. Most members of this order are members of the imperial family or 
nobles in their own right. Very few commoners have ever attained this rank 
throughout the order’s 327 year history. In all only around 5 per cent of the 
knights in Kalamar belong to this order.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<font color="#800080" face="Garamond" size="4"><b>History:</b> Emperor Galemak 
II was an infamously insecure man who lavished favours upon his courtiers as a 
means of securing the flattery he so badly craved. Early in his reign the 
Emperor tried to reward some of his favourites (some of who were rumoured at the 
time to be his lovers) by creating them Knights of the Platinum Lion. This idea 
outraged the old elite amongst his court and they strenuously resisted his 
plans. Fearing the wraith of these powerful nobles but still anxious to reward 
his favourites the Emperor came up with a compromise plan (or more likely his 
Imperial Chamberlain came up with the plan and the Emperor claimed credit for 
it). The Emperor created a new order of knighthood: The Order of the Black 
Banner. This order was named after the sacred Black Banner which has been 
unfurled whenever the Emperor (or King) takes the field since the foundation of 
the Kingdom of Kalamar and is said to have been blessed by the Old Man himself. 
And since the purpose of this order was to reward his favourites he decreed that 
knights of the new order shall have precedence over those of the Order of the 
Vast Empire. Thus, the Emperor was able to indulge in his nepotism without 
overly alienating the powerful within his realm. Subsequent Emperor’s decided to 
retain Galemak’s order and now members of the order make up around 25 per cent 
of the Empire’s chivalry.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">
<font color="#800080" face="Garamond" size="4"><b>History:</b> At the same time 
the Order of the Platinum Lion was being created, Emperor Vilik I also signed 
the decree ordering the creation of a lesser knighthood; the Order of the Vast 
Empire. This knighthood is easily the most common throughout the empire with 
most newly created knights being dubbed a member of this order. This order is 
also the least exclusive of Kalamar’s knightly orders with some famous examples 
of commoners rising though its ranks, such as Sir Ferasol Mornstar who rose from 
a gladiator to become the Grand Knight of the Order in 489 IR. It is also 
knights of this order who make up much of the Empire’s mounted chivalry in the 
legions. In all, about 70 per cent of the knights in Kalamar belong to this 
order.</font></p>
