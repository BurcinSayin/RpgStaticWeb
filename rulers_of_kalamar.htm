    decided that they they were restless because they missed the glory days of 
    the Empire, when men like Rulakan and Fulakan ruled - great conquerors. Thus 
    Vilik IV would gain his peoples admiration through mighty conquests and what 
    better target than the realms which rebelled under his fathers rule. Thus in 
    344 IR the Emperor set off at the head of his legions to retake Korak and 
    P'Bapar. Needless to say Kalamar's long neglected legions were crushed by 
    Koraks finely honed armies and the Emperor narrowly escaped capture. Fleeing 
    back to the Bet Kalamar, the Emperor ordered those legionary commanders who 
    survived the campaign executed and began to distance himself from the whole

    contemporary sages described the Emperor as something of a simpleton who 
    cared little about the Empire he ruled. He certainly lacked the ruthlessness 
    usually evident in the Bakar family, as demonstrated in 387 IR when Ek'Gekal 
    descended into civil war following the death of the last king without an 
    heir. When told the news of the king's death, Fonamar is reported to have 
    nodded vacantly and then returned to watching the play being staged in his 
    honour. When Ek'Gekal's remaining nobles were expelled and the merchants 
    declared the realm a free state, Kalamar did nothing. Still despite his

    struck the Alufalik Hills causing widespread devastation in the eastern 
    provinces of the realm. Many of the common people saw this as a sign that 
    gods were angry with the Bakar line and a new wave of rebellions plagued the 
    land, spurred on by the resurgent Guardians of the Hidden Flame. Eventually 
    imperial troops, with the help pro-Bakar priests, restored order and the 
    Guardians melted once more into the shadows. Exploration of the meteor 
    impact site yielded an enormous piece of deep purple amethyst which the 
    realm's most renowned artisans carved into a new throne stylized to 
    represent the lion of House Bakar. Power enchantments are also rumoured to 
    have been woven into the throne. Thereafter, the office of the emperor was 
    colloquially known as the Amethyst Throne.</font></td>

    could deal with his insecurities was to surround himself with a vast cohort 
    of flatterers. Thus, during his reign, the size of the imperial court rose 
    from around 900 courtiers in 435 IR to close to 10,000 courtiers by 455 IR. 
    This, combined with the emperors inclination to bestow lavish rewards upon 
    his favourites, meant the realm's need for revenue increased enormously. 
    Thus taxes nearly tripled during the first 20 years of the emperor's reign 
    and more rebellions sprung up throughout the Empire. The most serious 
    occurred in&nbsp; 456 IR when Pekal seceded from the Empire and 459 IR when Paru'Bor 
    was also able to achieved independence. The emperor in Bet Kalamar ordered 
    retaliations but assisted by the elves of Cilorea his forces were repelled. 
    461 IR saw the elven wizard Shifan appointed the new Imperial Diviner after

    the weakest and most incompetent emperor to ever sit upon the Amethyst 
    Throne. Whilst many of his predecessors had been cruel and despotic, Galemak 
    III was indecisive when faced with even the most minute decision and so much 
    of the power of the imperial court passed into the hands of the regional 
    aristocracy. This was most effectively demonstrated in 484 IR when the King 
    of Tokis died with no heir. A civil war immediately broke out, as nobles 
    vied for the vacant throne, which the Emperor of Kalamar seemed powerless to 
    prevent. Then in 490 IR the Emperor (or more correctly the Imperial 
    Chancellor, who had by this stage become the de facto ruler of the Empire) 
    ordered an invasion of Tharggy by Dodera and O'Par, Duke Ukadoran II of 
    O'Par ignored the command. When no retaliation came from Bet Kalamar the 
    Duke went one step further and declared the independence of his realm. Thus 
    another realm slipped out of the emperor's grasp.</font></td>

    within his nobility to break with the Empire. Thus in 544 IR another largely

    strengthened the authority of the Amethyst Throne by bringing his nobles to
